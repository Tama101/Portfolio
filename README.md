# Statistical Analysis of Family Violence In West Java During 2017 to 2021

The statistical analysis of family violence in West Java during 2017 to 2021 using Python, SQL, and visualization aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and characteristics of family violence in the region over the past five years. The primary objective of the project was to perform both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses on the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and potential contributing factors to family violence in the region.

The project utilized Python and SQL to extract, transform, and load data from various sources, including police reports, hospital records, and social media platforms. The dataset was then cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed using various statistical techniques, such as measures of central tendency, correlation analysis, and regression analysis.

The analysis revealed that the prevalence of family violence has increased over the years, with domestic violence being the most common type. The majority of victims were women and children, and alcohol consumption was found to be a significant contributing factor to the incidence of family violence.

To better understand the trends and patterns in the data, various visualizations, such as heatmaps, line charts, and bar graphs, were created using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visualizations helped to highlight the spatial and temporal distribution of family violence cases and identify potential hotspots and trends over time.

Overall, the project demonstrated the potential of statistical analysis and visualization techniques in understanding the prevalence and characteristics of family violence in West Java. The findings can be used by policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders to develop more effective strategies and interventions to prevent and address family violence in the region.
